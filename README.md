> Do, or do not. There is no 'try'.

## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Explain that the files they will write their code in within Xcode will be the .swift files they see in the Project Navigator.
* Connect the View Controller in the storyboard file to the ViewController.swift file.
* Locate and use the Assistant Editor
* Pull up the Assistant Editor using the hotkey, command + option + return.
* Hide the Assistant Editor using the hotkey, command + return.
* control + drag a Label/Button/View from the View Controller Scene into their ViewController.swift file and name it. They should know the proper naming convention, similar to how they've been naming their variables (lower camel case)

## What the student can do at this point 

* More stuff

## Outline / Notes

*  Explain to the student that writing their code in a .swift file within Xcode is identical to how they wrote their code within a Playground file. In fact, they actually were writing their code in a .swift file when working with the playground file.
* Be thorough with screenshots and an explanation as to how they setup the Class of their View Controller to the ViewController.swift file.
* When selecting any of the UI elements that are located in their View. Explain how they can use the Attributes inspector to change the background color, font (if applicable).
* If you like, you can have them either follow along with you through screenshots or have them open an Xcode project (which is included) that makes them follow along. I think I'm more inclined to have them follow along with you in an Xcode file. I've included the Xcode file to this repo. (Auto Layout & Size Classes have been disabled)
